面试官您好，我叫杨洋。来自南京邮电大学通信与信息工程学院，目前研二在读，研究方向是 图信号处理。本科我就读于 临沂 大学，电子信息科学与技术 专业。在校期间，我学业奖学金。此外，我也参加过许多数学建模竞赛，包括 江苏省研究生数学建模科研创新实践大赛、“华为杯”研究生数学建模竞赛等，拿到了 三等奖。

目前发了一篇论文是基于图信号处理的 MVDR 波束形成多通道语音增强它是，国家自然科学基金（62071242）和江苏省科研与实践创新计划（SJCX20_0245）资助项目。将图信号处理技术 引入多通道语音增强，提出了多通道图傅里叶变换和图频域MVDR，提升了增强语音的质量和可懂性。

业余时间我也有学习阅读新技术论文的习惯，会定期归纳总结自己的笔记。

以上就是我的个人介绍，谢谢您。





Good morning, sirs,I am glad to be here for this interview.

my name is Yang Yang and i'm  24 years old, I am studying for a master's degree at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and my research direction is the Research on Theory and Technology of Graph Signal Processing for Speech

Undergraduate I studied at Linyi University, majoring in electronic information science and technology. During school, I received academic scholarship. In addition, I have also participated in many mathematical modeling competitions, including the Jiangsu Province Postgraduate Mathematical Modeling Research and Innovation Practice Competition, the "Huawei Cup" Postgraduate Mathematical Modeling Competition,and won the third prize.

Currently, a paper has been published called **Multi-channel speech enhancement of MVDR beamforming based on Graph Signal Processing**.It is a project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Jiangsu Provincial Scientific Research and Practice Innovation Program .

This paper introduced the graph signal processing technology into multi-channel speech enhancement, and  proposed the multi-channel graph Fourier transform and graph frequency domain MVDR to improve the quality and intelligibility of the enhanced speech.

In my spare time, I also have the habit of learning to read new technical papers, and I will regularly summarize my notes.

The above is my personal introduction, thank you
